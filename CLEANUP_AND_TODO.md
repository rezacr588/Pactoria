## üìù Notes

- The codebase is about **75% complete** for MVP based on the plan
- All critical backend infrastructure is working
- Main gaps are in collaboration UX and export features
- Testing infrastructure exists but needs more test coverage
- Docker and CI/CD are properly configured but may need environment-specific adjustments

## üîß Configuration Needed

Before deployment, ensure these are configured:
1. **Supabase Storage** - Create `contracts` bucket for exports
2. **Email Provider** - Configure SMTP for notifications
3. **Groq API Key** - Set in environment variables
4. **Stripe Keys** - Configure for production billing
5. **Hocuspocus Server** - Deploy if better collaboration needed
